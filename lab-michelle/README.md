## Lab 22: Reddit Scraper



    create the following components and structure them according to the diagram below:

App
 SearchForm
 SearchResultList

App Component

    should contain all of the application state
    should contain methods for modifying the application state
    the state should have a topics array for holding the results of the search

SearchForm Component

    should contain a text input for the user to supply a reddit board to look up
    should contain a number input for the user to limit the number of results to return
        the number must be greater than 0 and less than 100
    onSubmit the form should make a request to reddit
        it should make a get request to http://www.reddit.com/r/${searchFormBoard}.json?limit=${searchFormLimit}
        on success, it should pass the results to the application state
        on failure, it should add a class to the form called "error"
            this should apply a red border to the form elements (shows a visual user validation error)

SearchResultList Component

    should inherit all search results through props
        this component does not need to have its own state!
    if there are topics listed in the application state, it should display an unordered list of topics
    each list item should contain the following
        an <a> tag with an href that points to the topic.url
        inside the <a> tag, include an <h2> tag with the topic.title
        after the <a> tag (not nested as a child), include a <span> tag with the number of topic.ups (topic upvotes)
